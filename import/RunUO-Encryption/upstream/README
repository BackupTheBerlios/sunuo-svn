RunUO-Encryption 2.1 (Released 20.10.2005)
==========================================

CHANGES IN VERSION 2.1:
Support for the 0xf1 UO Gateway stat request packet. This also
fixes the remote admin interface.

CHANGES IN VERSION 2.0:
If you are using RunUO 1.0, this version requires you to
make a modification to your core allowing a great performance
improvement. For details on the core modification, read
this forum post:
http://www.runuo.com/forum/showthread.php?p=463268

I also added new encryption keys to Configuration.cs.

This package will allow unmodified Ultima Online clients to log in to your shard
without the use of UOGateway, UORice or similar tools.

To enable this package, Copy the Scripts folder into your RunUO installation directory.
It should not overwrite any files. All encryption scripts reside in the Engines\Encryption
subdirectory.

If you want to change the configuration of the script, please look at 
Scripts\Engines\Encryption\Configuration.cs.

This script is using a port of the reference Twofish implementation done by Shaun Wilde 
published here: http://www.codetools.com/csharp/twofish_csharp.asp.

The code of this script is licensed under the GPL. Please see the file COPYING for details.

If you want to contact me, you may do so by sending me a personal message on the RunUO boards.
